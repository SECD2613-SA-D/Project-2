# Topic: Online Restaurant Reservation System

# 1.0 Overview of the Project

     Previously we discussed the Online Restaurant Reservation System which seeks to develop an innovative web-based program
     that enriches the dining experience for both customers and restaurant staff.
     We talked about how customers can make smooth online reservations, check table availability, and receive speedy confirmation emails.
     Moreover, the proposal also focused on the background, methodology, resources, budget, reporting, and risks.
     There were a few objectives, for example automating the sending of confirmation emails using the user’s information from the website,
     creating a standardized display of available tables in the restaurant for the specified time slots, etc.
     After analyzing and calculating the budget we got a total of $101,600.

# 2.0 Problem Statement

     There are restaurants that still utilize the old reservation methods such as phone calls or walk-ins.
     This often results in miscommunication, double bookings, or prolonged waiting for confirmations.
     While managing reservations manually, sometimes restaurants overbook too.
     As customers cannot view the available time slots, they have to contact the restaurant multiple times which can cause exasperation.
     When users do not receive immediate confirmation notification it leads to unreliability.
     Customers struggle with canceling since they have to contact the restaurant directly.
     It often leads to mismanagement and missed rebooking opportunities as restaurants cannot immediately update availability after cancellation.
     Furthermore, restaurants fail to manage their resources constructively resulting in deteriorating revenue.
     The online reservation system will enable users to view available tables and make reservations with ease with an interactive interface.
     Most importantly, they can cancel and modify their booking through the online portal.
     This system will widely benefit the restaurant too. They can remind and confirm customers automatically to maintain effective communication.
     In addition to that, it's possible to acquire data and insights to enhance efficiency and raise customer satisfaction.

# 3.0 Proposed solution

     We aim to maximize table management while improving the dining experience for clients and restaurant employees.
     The user interface will have a list of restaurants, a reservation form, and user account management.
     The list of restaurants will contain location, contact information, running hours, etc.
     The booking form will mainly focus on the date and time along with other reservation details.
     Customers can create their own accounts and use them to modify anything related to the reservation.
     A database will be used to store information and reservations for flexibility.
     Upon cancellation, the reservation status will be updated to “Canceled” in the database and free up that time slot.
     SMS service will be used to send reminders whereas emails will be used for automatic confirmation right after booking.
     Both SMS and emails can also be used to send notifications of successful cancellation of booking.

# 4.0 Information Gathering Process

     The information-gathering process involves collecting necessary and relevant data for creating a feasible system, identifying
     its flaws and challenges, and determining the requirements for the system to be successful. This section will outline the
     methods used which are Questionnaires and Interviews in the process of gathering information.

     4.1 Methods used
          a. Questionnaire
               - Allows a large sample of stakeholders to be involved in the Questionnaire efficiently
               - Allows anonymous data to be collected which encourages more honest feedback
               - Flexible in the sense that respondents can complete the questionnaire at their leisure
         
          b. Interview
               - Allows respondents to give in-depth responses that can help micro-adjust our system to perfection
               - Builds personal connections with interviewees which may lead to a more successful launch
               - Allows tailored approaches, different sets of interviews can be used depending on the interviewee's background.

     4.2 Summary of Methods Used

               These methods are used to gather the necessary information by allowing direct interaction with stakeholders and
               potential users to record their preferences, feedback, and requirements for online restaurant reservation systems.
               We also research existing popular online reservation systems to take note on what makes the system attractive and 
               successful.

# 6.0 Summary of Requirement Analysis Process

     The requirement analysis process for our Online Restaurant Reservation System is done by detailed examinations of the 
     current reservation systems by other successful businesses. We also analyzed the functional and non-functional requirements
     as well as prepared logical data flow diagrams (DFD) that represent the AS-IS system.

          Here is each segment summarised:

               5.1 Current Business Process: 
                    Two primary scenarios were outlined, Online Reservations and Cancellation of Reservations.
                    Detailed workflows are provided for each instance observations between the customers and restaurant staff
                    were recorded.

               5.2 Functional Requirements: 
                    We identified input, process, and output requirements. Furthermore, we include 
                    customer details, managing table availability, and generating confirmation emails.

               5.3 Non-functional Requirments:
                    We specify the control requirements and constructed a system that efficiently handles simultaneous user
                    inputs, provide real-time updates, ensure customers with quick responses, maintain the uptime of 
                    the system and implement regulations for control.

               5.4 Logical DFD AS-IS System:
                    We construct logical DFD diagrams to portray the context, processes, and data flow within the system.
                    The diagrams extend to a Context diagram, Diagram 0, and a Child diagram highlighting the main processes and data stores.

          Overall summary:

               During this study, we aimed to understand the existing system's features and functionalities, its limitations, and 
               possible improvements. By constructing informative DFD diagrams, we highlight the workflows, and functional and
               non-functional requirements and use this data as a foundation for the next steps of the project which are
               the design and implementation phases. The study also provides a scope for the project that will guide the team
               to develop an efficient and successful Online Reservation System that overcomes the identified challenges
               and satisfies its requirements.
