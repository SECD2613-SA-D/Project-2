# Topic: Online Restaurant Reservation System

# 1.0 Overview of the Project
Previously we discussed the Online Restaurant Reservation System which seeks to develop an innovative web-based program
that enriches the dining experience for both customers and restaurant staff.
We talked about how customers can make smooth online reservations, check table availability, and receive speedy confirmation emails.
Moreover, the proposal also focused on the background, methodology, resources, budget, reporting, and risks.
There were a few objectives, for example automating the sending of confirmation emails using the user’s information from the website,
creating a standardized display of available tables in the restaurant for the specified time slots, etc.
After analyzing and calculating the budget we got a total of $101,600.

# 2.0 Problem Statement
There are restaurants that still utilize the old reservation methods such as phone calls or walk-ins.
This often results in miscommunication, double bookings, or prolonged waiting for confirmations.
While managing reservations manually, sometimes restaurants overbook too.
As customers cannot view the available time slots, they have to contact the restaurant multiple times which can cause exasperation.
When users do not receive immediate confirmation notification it leads to unreliability.
Customers struggle with canceling since they have to contact the restaurant directly.
It often leads to mismanagement and missed rebooking opportunities as restaurants cannot immediately update availability after cancellation.
Furthermore, restaurants fail to manage their resources constructively resulting in deteriorating revenue.
The online reservation system will enable users to view available tables and make reservations with ease with an interactive interface.
Most importantly, they can cancel and modify their booking through the online portal.
This system will widely benefit the restaurant too. They can remind and confirm customers automatically to maintain effective communication.
In addition to that, it's possible to acquire data and insights to enhance efficiency and raise customer satisfaction.

# 3.0 Proposed solution
We aim to maximize table management while improving the dining experience for clients and restaurant employees.
To achieve that, the system will have a well-designed user interface.
It will have a list of restaurants, a reservation form, and user account management.
The list of restaurants will contain location, contact information, running hours, etc.
The booking form will mainly focus on the date and time along with other reservation details.
Customers can create their own accounts and use them to modify anything related to the reservation.
A cancellation link or button will be available beside the reservations.
A database will be used to store information and reservations for flexibility.
Upon cancellation, the reservation status will be updated to “Canceled” in the database and free up that time slot.
It is essential to place a safe authentication, guaranteeing data security via encryption, and adhering to privacy laws.
SMS service will be used to send reminders whereas emails will be used for automatic confirmation right after booking.
Both SMS and emails can also be used to send notification of successful cancellation of booking.
Reservation management tools are needed for checking upcoming reservations and getting in touch with customers if needed.

# 5.0 Requirement Analysis

     5.1 Current Business Process
        •	Scenario 1: Online Reservations
            a.	Workflow:
                  1.	Customers visit the restaurant's website.
                  2.	Customers navigate to the reservation system page.
                  3.	Customers enter reservation details (name, contact information, number of guests, date, and time).
                  4.	The system checks real-time table availability.
                  5.	If a table is available, the system confirms the reservation and sends a confirmation email to the customer.
                  6.	If no table is available, the system offers alternative time slots or adds the customer to a waiting list.
                  7.	On the day of the reservation, the host/hostess uses the system to check reservations and seat customers.
        •	Scenario 2: Cancellation of Reservations
            b. Workflow:
                  1.	Customers who wish to cancel their reservation notify the restaurant.
                  2.	The host/hostess accesses the reservation system.
                  3.	The host/hostess locates the reservation and marks it as canceled.
                  4.	The system updates table availability and sends a cancellation confirmation to the customer.

     5.2 Functional Requirements

            -	Cancellation request details.
        •	Process:
            -	Store customer reservation details (online).
            -	Manage and update table availability in real-time.
            -	Generate and maintain a waiting list for online customers.
            -	Allocate tables based on reservation and customer details.
            -	Send reservation confirmation emails to customers.
            -	Process cancellation requests and update table availability accordingly.

            -	Reservation and customer lists for staff reference.
            -	Real-time table availability display on the website.
            -	Cancellation confirmation email sent to the customer.

     5.3 Non-functional Requirements
        •	Performance:
            -	The system must handle a large number of simultaneous user requests efficiently.
